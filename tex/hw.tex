	\section*{Tools and source files}
	Some problems were solved using \href{https://www.minizinc.org/software.html}{MiniZinc Software}. \href{https://www.minizinc.org/doc-2.7.0/en/index.html}{The MiniZinc Handbook} contains detailed instructions on how to run .mnz models and use .dzn data files. In this homework, some models use an adjacency matrix (g.dzn), other models use a list of edges (edges.dzn), others use a list of edges and the number of vertices (edges and v num.dzn). \\\\
	Some of the calculations were done (and the source code for graphviz was obtained) using console C++ applications built with a help of CMake. As the .exe file is located at {\textless}src folder{\textgreater}/Build/Debug, all input and output .txt files in the code begin with '../../' as it's convenient to work with them in the src folder just in IDE.\\\\
	To visualise the graphs, \url{https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/} was used (all graphs visualized using fdp engine).\\\\
	All source files
	\section*{Task 1}
	
	% Add text, formulas, and images
	This is an example of a \LaTeX\  document that includes text, mathematical formulas, and images. Here is an example formula:
	
	And here is an example image:
	
	\begin{figure}[h]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{example-image.png}
		\caption{An example PNG image}
		\label{fig:example-image}
	\end{figure}
	
	You can also include URLs using the \texttt{url} package:
	
	\href{https://www.example.com}{Click on me}
